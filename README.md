- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zyuhaoMe. I'm currently a graduate student in mechanical engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computational fluid dynamics, high performance computing and physic-based numerical modeling! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on topics such as CFD, heat transfer and computational material.
- I hope one day I could develop a parallel computing numerical library especially for CPP user to beat mordern Fortran, hahaha.
- But, who knows, maybe cpp itself would be beaten by carbon withtin the next few decades, haha.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: please email me : zhouyuhao2020@gmail.com
